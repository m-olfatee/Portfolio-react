            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hello again, it seems you are still interested in reading more about me.
                I am a computer engineer from Iran with a past theoretical programming experience.
                Well, surely the question arises, what did I do then?
                I have more than 12 years of experience in the production line of business,
                which is divided into two completely different sectors.
                The first part was the production of  clay pottery for artists with special needs
                and the second part was the production of pet bottles from 30 ml to 5 liters.
            </p>
            <p>I gained a lot of experience in both fields and I enjoyed both of them.
                However, after migrating to Germany abd because of the pandemic situation and mostly my
                genuine interest in the world of computers, I shifted back to my original field of study to
                try to enter this rapidly evolving and growing market by reviving my old knowledge.
                I am constantly interested in learning new topics which helped me to become familiar
                with the basics of web development within a year and I am eager to overcome the new challenges in my career.
